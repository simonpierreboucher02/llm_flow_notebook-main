    "### **Overview**\n",
    "The following code implements a modular framework for interacting with different language model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral) to generate text, retrieve embeddings, perform semantic searches, and process multi-step prompt flows. This code is designed to facilitate dynamic text generation and data processing using various models in a structured workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries and Setting Up the Environment**\n",
    "    - Imports necessary modules, including `asyncio`, `aiohttp` (for async HTTP requests), and `logging` for logging messages.\n",
    "    - Loads environment variables using `dotenv` to manage API keys securely.\n",
    "    - Initializes `colorama` for text styling in console output and applies `nest_asyncio` for async functionality in Jupyter environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logging and Environment Variable Loading**\n",
    "    - Configures logging to display messages with the time and level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).\n",
    "    - Loads API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`) from the environment variables to interact with different model APIs.\n",
    "    - Warns if any of the API keys are not set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Utility Function**\n",
    "    - **`num_tokens_from_string`**: Calculates the number of tokens in a string based on the specified model using `tiktoken`. This helps in managing input length for different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Exception Class**\n",
    "    - **`APIException`**: Defines a custom exception to handle API-related errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Abstract Base Class (`ModelAPI`)**\n",
    "    - Implements an abstract class to define a common interface for model APIs. It includes abstract methods `generate_text` (to generate text) and `extract_text_from_response` (to parse the response).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **API Implementations**\n",
    "    - **`OpenAIAPI`**, **`AnthropicAPI`**, and **`MistralAPI`**: Concrete classes implementing the `ModelAPI` abstract base class. Each has:\n",
    "        - An `__init__` method to store the API key.\n",
    "        - An `async` method `generate_text` to send requests to the respective model API.\n",
    "        - A method `extract_text_from_response` to extract the generated text from the API's response.\n",
    "        - The OpenAI class includes an additional method `get_embeddings` to retrieve text embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`APIClient` Class**\n",
    "    - Initializes instances of the API classes (`OpenAIAPI`, `AnthropicAPI`, `MistralAPI`).\n",
    "    - **`generate_text`**: Determines which API to use based on the model name and handles token limit constraints. Calls the `generate_text` method of the respective API.\n",
    "    - **`split_and_process`**: If the prompt exceeds the token limit, splits the prompt into smaller parts, processes them, and combines the responses. Summarizes the response if the combined text exceeds the token limit.\n",
    "    - **`get_embeddings`**: Uses the OpenAI API to fetch embeddings for a list of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`PromptBlock` Class**\n",
    "    - Represents a unit of work (block) in the prompt flow. Each block has properties like `prompt`, `model`, `max_tokens`, and `temperature`.\n",
    "    - Stores external data (e.g., URL) or semantic search settings.\n",
    "    - **`add_input`**: Specifies input connections from other blocks.\n",
    "    - **`load_external_data`**: Fetches and processes external data (API, website, PDF) asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **`Step` Class**\n",
    "    - Contains a list of `PromptBlock` objects to represent an individual step in the workflow.\n",
    "    - **`add_block`**: Adds a `PromptBlock` to the step.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **`SemanticSearch` Class**\n",
    "    - Handles semantic search using text embeddings.\n",
    "    - **`split_text`**: Splits text into smaller chunks.\n",
    "    - **`cosine_similarity`**: Calculates cosine similarity between two vectors.\n",
    "    - **`search`**: Asynchronously performs semantic search on chunks of text to find the most relevant segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **`FlowManager` Class**\n",
    "    - Manages the overall workflow consisting of multiple steps and blocks.\n",
    "    - Initializes an `APIClient` and `SemanticSearch` instance.\n",
    "    - **`add_step`**: Adds a `Step` object to the workflow.\n",
    "    - **`process_step`**: Processes all blocks in a given step, fetching input texts, external data, and performing semantic searches if specified. Executes the prompts using the API client.\n",
    "    - **`collect_input_texts`**: Gathers input texts from connected blocks in previous steps.\n",
    "    - **`run_flow`**: Executes the entire workflow, processing each step in order.\n",
    "    - **`display_step_results`**: Displays the results of each block in a step.\n",
    "    - **`visualize_flow`** and **`generate_dot_code`**: Generates a graphical representation of the workflow using Graphviz.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Helper Function (`create_modular_flow`)**\n",
    "    - Accepts a configuration for steps and blocks, constructs a `FlowManager` with steps and blocks based on the configuration, and returns the `FlowManager` object for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "The code implements an asynchronous framework to interact with multiple language model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral). It defines classes to structure and manage the input prompts, data processing, and text generation in a multi-step flow. This modular design allows for flexible addition of steps, blocks, and API interactions, making it a versatile tool for complex prompt flows."

      "Output: ### Key Information about Military Theory\n",
      "\n",
      "**Definition and Scope:**\n",
      "Military theory is the study of the principles and concepts that define, inform, guide, and explain war and warfare. It goes beyond mere description of military history to analyze normative behaviors and causal aspects of warfare. The theory seeks to explain the conditions for military victory and provide guidance on how wars should be fought.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Questions Addressed:**\n",
      "1. What is the nature of war?\n",
      "2. What forms does war take (its character)?\n",
      "3. How are wars won (the application of military power)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Military theory is distinct from military philosophy, which deals with the ethical dimensions of warfare, such as the reasons for going to war (jus ad bellum) and the conduct within war (jus in bello).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Historical Context:**\n",
      "The foundations of military theory can be traced back to early military philosophers such as Thucydides and Sun Tzu. Their works, *History of the Peloponnesian War* and *The Art of War*, respectively, remain influential in understanding the causes of war and strategies for conducting warfare.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Output: The philosophy of war is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, causes, and ethical implications of war. It intersects with various fields, including political philosophy, international relations, and the philosophy of law. Key topics within this philosophy include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Just War Theory**: This framework addresses the morality of warfare and outlines conditions under which war can be justified. The core principles include:\n",
      "   - **Just Authority**: Only legitimate authorities have the right to declare war.\n",
      "   - **Just Cause**: There must be a valid reason for going to war, such as self-defense or protecting human rights.\n",
      "   - **Right Intention**: The motives behind engaging in war must be morally sound.\n",
      "   - **Last Resort**: War should only be undertaken after all other options have been exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Works about the Philosophy of War**: Influential texts in this field include:\n",
      "   - **On War** by Carl von Clausewitz, which discusses the nature of war and its relation to politics.\n",
      "   - **War and Peace** by Leo Tolstoy, which offers a critical view of war and its implications on humanity.\n",

The philosophy of war encompasses various perspectives that explore the ethical, political, and social implications of warfare. Below is a summary of the main philosophical perspectives regarding war derived from the provided data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ethical Perspectives on War**:\n",
      "   - **Just War Theory**: This perspective evaluates the justifications for going to war (jus ad bellum) and the moral conduct in war (jus in bello). It argues that war can be morally justified under certain conditions, such as self-defense or protecting the innocent.\n",
      "   - **Pacifism**: Opposing war under any circumstances, pacifism emphasizes peaceful resolutions and nonviolence. Philosophers like Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi championed this view, advocating for moral and ethical obligations to avoid violence.\n",
      "   - **Utilitarianism**: This consequentialist perspective assesses war based on the outcomes it produces. A war is considered justifiable if it leads to the greatest good for the greatest number, weighing the benefits against the suffering caused.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Political Perspectives**:\n",
      "   - **Realism**: Realist theorists argue that war is an inevitable aspect of international relations, driven by the anarchic nature of the international system. They emphasize power dynamics and the pursuit of national interests, often prioritizing state survival over moral considerations.\n",
      "   - **Liberalism**: Unlike realism, liberalism seeks to promote peace through international cooperation, democracy, and institutions. It argues that democracies are less likely to engage in warfare with one another (the Democratic Peace Theory).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Historical and Cultural Perspectives**:\n",
      "   - **Hegelian Dialectics**: Hegel viewed war\n",

The use of autonomous weapon systems raises questions about the moral responsibility for actions taken by machines and the potential detachment of human judgment from warfare. As military practitioners navigate the complexities of modern technologies, they must also consider the ethical ramifications of their use, ensuring that actions remain aligned with international humanitarian law and moral principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ethical Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "The intersection of military theory and the philosophy of war is particularly relevant in light of contemporary ethical considerations surrounding warfare. Issues such as just war theory, proportionality, and the protection of non-combatants are more prominent as the consequences of military actions become more scrutinized by international communities and domestic audiences alike. Military theorists need to integrate ethical frameworks into their strategic decision-making, promoting strategies that not only seek victory but also respect human rights and minimize harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the ongoing debates about warfare’s legitimacy—such as interventionist versus non-interventionist perspectives in conflicts like those in Syria and Ukraine—highlight the necessity for military practitioners to be well-versed in ethical discourse. The decisions to engage in or abstain from military action should be grounded in a thorough understanding of both military effectiveness and moral justification.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current Global Conflicts\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexities of current global conflicts underscore the importance of a holistic approach that combines military theory and the philosophy of war. In conflicts driven by identity politics, terrorism, and asymmetric warfare, traditional military strategies may fall short. The adaptability required in military theory must be complemented by philosophical insights into the underlying causes of conflict and the perspectives of various stakeholders involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, in counterinsurgency operations, understanding the socio-political dynamics and the motivations of local populations is crucial. Military practitioners must employ strategies that engage these factors while being aware of the ethical implications of their approaches. This might include efforts to build trust with local communities rather than solely focusing on military defeat of adversaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the integration of military theory and the philosophy of war is essential for addressing the challenges of modern warfare and international relations. As technology evolves and ethical considerations take center stage, military practitioners and policymakers must strive for a balanced understanding that encompasses operational effectiveness and moral integrity. By doing so, they can navigate the complexities of contemporary conflicts and contribute to a more stable and just international order. The dialogue between these fields will remain vital as societies seek to reconcile the imperatives of security with the values of humanity.\n",
